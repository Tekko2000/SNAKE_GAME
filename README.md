Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

I created this old school snake game while I was learning JavaScript at the Frontend Career Path 
at www.scrimba.com
Learning JavaScript with this little gaming project was a lot of fun and I am really glad that the tutor @AniaKubow explained it step by step so I could understand the concepts of JavaScript a lot more.
Hope you will enjoy playing it on your computer ðŸ˜ƒ
